Personal todo list:
===================

New items are added under "TODO", everything that is finished is moved under
"DONE", with the planned release version in brackets.
When a feature is officially released (no rc-ebuild!), it is removed.

------------
--- TODO ---
------------
These are mandatory for the next release cycle:

These are planned:
- Add package filter per command line argument
- Handle USE_EXPAND and USE_EXPAND_HIDDEN flags

These ideas for the (far far away) future
- Add an optional sqlite3 backend. This could then be used to have ufed parse
  the tree (metadata.xml!) and store the findings in a database file. Parsing
  the tree like that is too much for each startup. Therefore such a db caching
  would enable ufed to be no longer restricted to the profiles and /var/db/pkg.

--- DONE ---
------------
These have been finished :

- (0.90) Add Filter local/global.
- (0.90) Add Filter installed/all.
- (0.90) Add parsing of /etc/make.profile/package.use for command line
         packages.
- (0.90) Comment code.
- (0.90) Add profile /etc/portage/profile as last profile if not there.
         (User overrides)
- (0.90) Parse profiles: use.force and package.use.force.
    These are added as masked but enabled flags.
    Prefix '-' reverts the masking and the forced enabling
- (0.90) Parse profiles: use.mask and package.use.mask.
    These are added as masked but disabled flags.
    Prefix '-' reverts the masking
- (0.90) Remove obsolete file references.
- (0.90) Update documentation.
- (0.90) Do not break if FEATURES contain invalid values:
    Couldn't read FEATURES variable contains unknown value(s): inv
    /var/db/pkg
    Compilation failed in require at /usr/sbin/ufed line 9.
    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /usr/sbin/ufed line 9.
- (0.90) Filter masked flags reliably.
- (0.90) Add an option to re-show masked USE flags, but in parantheses.
- (0.90) Add toggling package list display.
- (0.90) Handle setups where /etc/portage/make.conf is a directory.
- (0.90) Read PORTDIR and PORTDIR_OVERLAY from portageq, too.
- (0.90) Make searching and cursor placement reliable.

- (0.91) Add line wrapping.
- (0.91) Make key help buttons dynamic (text, placement and width).
- (0.91) Replace status indicator with dynamic status line.
- (0.91) ufed does not error out when USE in make.conf is exceptionally large.
- (0.91) The deprecated 'portageq envvar' is no longer used for to determine
         PORTDIR and PORTDIR_OVERLAY, eix is used if available and portageq
         with the get_repo(s|_path) command as a fallback.
