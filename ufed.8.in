ufed \- Gentoo Linux USE flags editor
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B ufed 
.SH "INTRODUCTION"
UFED is a simple program designed to help you configure the systems USE flags
(see below) to your liking. To enable or disable a flag highlight it and hit
space.

ufed edits the USE flag settings in your make.conf file only. It can not be
used to edit your package.use file.

If you have two make.conf files, @GENTOO_PORTAGE_EPREFIX@/etc/make.conf and
@GENTOO_PORTAGE_EPREFIX@/etc/portage/make.conf, ufed reads the first, overrides
its settings with the second, and writes changes to the second.

If @GENTOO_PORTAGE_EPREFIX@/etc/portage/make.conf is a directory, ufed will
parse all files in this directory recursively, omitting files that begin with a
'.' or end with a '~', and will read all USE flag settings that can be found.
Changes are written to the last file found, overriding all others.

.B What are USE flags?

The USE settings system is a flexible way to enable or disable various features
at package build-time on a global level and for individual packages. This
allows an administrator to control how packages are built in regards to the
optional features which can be compiled into those packages.

For instance, packages with optional GNOME support can have this support
disabled at compile time by disabling the "gnome" USE flag. Enabling the
"gnome" USE flag would enable GNOME support in these packages.

The effect of USE flags on packages is dependent on whether both the
software itself and the package ebuild supports the USE flag as an optional
feature. If the software does not have support for an optional feature then the
corresponding USE flag will obviously have no effect.

Also many package dependencies are not considered optional by the software and
thus USE flags will have no effect on those mandatory dependencies.

A list of USE keywords used by a particular package can be found by checking
the IUSE line in any ebuild file or by using "equery" from gentoolkit.

See http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=2&chap=2
for more information on USE flags.

Please also note that if UFED describes a flag (Unknown) it generally means
that it is either a spelling error in one of the three configuration files or
it is not an officially sanctioned USE flag. Sanctioned USE flags can be found 
in @GENTOO_PORTAGE_EPREFIX@/usr/portage/profiles/use.desc and
in @GENTOO_PORTAGE_EPREFIX@/usr/portage/profiles/use.local.desc.

.B What are "global" and "local" USE flags?

Global USE flags are called such because they represent functionality that is
found in a wider variety of packages. For example, the global flag "cjk" is
about adding / not adding support for Eastern-Asian languages, which affects
a multitude of various packages. Global flags are described in
@GENTOO_PORTAGE_EPREFIX@/usr/portage/profiles/use.desc.

Local USE flags are unique package-wise, because the functionality they stand
for is only found in that particular package and no other. See
@GENTOO_PORTAGE_EPREFIX@/usr/portage/profiles/use.local.desc for a full, 
per-package listing of all local USE flags.

It still happens that a flag which is defined as global is also defined as
local for one or more packages. That is because the general definition of the
global flag takes on specialized semantics in some particular package. It also
occurs that multiple packages define a local flag of the same name - the
meaning of the flag differs, however, for each package.

.B What are "Masked" and "Forced" flags?

ufed allows to view the descriptions of flags that are either masked or forced.

If a USE flag does not apply to your system, or is highly experimental, it is
"masked" and can not be enabled.
.br
If a USE flag is mandatory for your system or for a specific package, it is
"forced" and can not be disabled.

Flags that are masked or forced globally have their names displayed in
parentheses, and are prefixed with a '-' if they are masked. If one of these
flags is set in your make.conf, you can remove it with ufed.
.br
If a flag is only masked or forced for specific packages, a lower case 'm'
or 'f' in the defaults column (see "Display layout" below) indicates this.

.SH "Navigation and control"

ufed will present you with a list of descriptions for each USE flag. If a
description is too long to fit on your screen, you can use the Left and Right
arrow keys to scroll the descriptions. Alternatively you can change the
description to show a reduced variant using the F10 key, or change the display
to wrap long lines into multiple lines using the F11 key.

Use the Up and Down arrow keys, the Page Up and Page Down keys, the Home and
End keys, or start typing the name of a flag to select it.
Use the space bar to toggle the setting.

You can apply various filters on the flags to display. The text of the bottom
line buttons show, which filter the button (or key press) will switch to.

F5: Toggle display of local / global / all flag descriptions.
.br
F6: Toggle display of flags supported by at least one installed
package / supported by no installed package / all flags.
.br
F7: Toggle display of masked and forced flags / flags that are
neither masked nor forced / all flags.

The default is to display all flags that are neither masked nor forced.

You can change the way the descriptions are displayed. The text of the
bottom line buttons show, which way the button (or key press) the display
will change to.

F9: Toggle the order of the affected package list and the description.
.br
F10: Toggle whether to display the full description or a stripped version.
.br
F11: Enable / disable wrapping of long lines.

The stripped version has various wordings like "Enables support for" or
"Build and install the" at the beginning of the description removed.
Although somewhat crippled, the descriptions key information then needs
less space and allows, with switched order of the package list and the
description, to determine a flags meaning without scrolling the text in most
cases; even on low resolution displays.

The default is to display the full description preceded by the list of
affected packages.

Below the list of descriptions an indicator line is displayed that shows the
current setting of all filters and settings.
.br
The order and layout is:
.br
[Scope|State|Mask|Order|Description|Wrapping] with
.br
Scope:
  glob : Global USE flags are shown.
  loca : Local USE flags are shown.
  all  : All USE flags are shown.
.br
State:
  inst : USE flags affecting installed packages are shown.
  noti : USE flags affecting not installed packages are shown.
  all  : All USE flags are shown
.br
Mask:
  mask : Masked and forced USE flags are shown
  norm : USE flags that are neither masked nor forced are shown.
  all  : All USE flags are shown.
.br
Order:
  left : The list of affected packages is shown left of the description.
  righ : The list of affected packages is shown right of the description.
.br
Description:
  orig : The original full description is shown.
  stri : The stripped version of the description is shown.
.br
Wrapping:
  long : The original one-line layout with horizontal scrolling.
  wrap : Wrapped lines that do not need horizontal scrolling.

If ncurses is installed with the "gpm" use flag enabled, you can use your
mouse to navigate and to toggle the settings, too.

After changing flags, press the Return or Enter key to save your USE flag setup
to make.conf, or press Escape to revert your changes.

Note: Depending on your system, you may need to wait a second before ufed
detects the Escape key or mouse clicks; in some cases, you can use the
ncurses environment variable ESCDELAY to change this. See \fBncurses\fR(3X)
for more info.

.SH "Display layout"

ufed attempts to show you where a particular use setting came from, and what
its scope and state is.

Each line consists of the following elements:

 (s) flag  |DPC|Si| (packages) description
.TP
\fB(s) : Your selection.\fR
.br
Either [+] to enable, [-] to disable, or empty to keep the default value. If a
flag is enabled or disabled by default, it will be shown as either (+) or (-). 
.TP
\fBflag : The name of the flag.\fR
.br
If the flag is globally masked, it will be shown as (-flag). If the flag is
globally forced, it will be shown as (flag).
.TP
\fBD : System [D]efault settings.\fR
.br
These are read from
@GENTOO_PORTAGE_EPREFIX@/usr/portage/profiles/.../make.defaults and the
\fBebuild\fR(5) IUSE defaults of installed packages. The settings in make.defaults,
however, take precedence over the ebuild IUSE settings.
.br
Masked flags are shown here as 'm', forced flags as 'f'.
.TP
\fBP : [P]rofile package settings.\fR
.br
These are read from
@GENTOO_PORTAGE_EPREFIX@/usr/portage/profiles/.../package.use. These package
specific settings take precedence over the [D]efault settings.
.TP
\fBC : [C]onfiguration settings.\fR
.br
These are read from @GENTOO_PORTAGE_EPREFIX@/etc/make.conf,
@GENTOO_PORTAGE_EPREFIX@/etc/portage/make.conf and
@GENTOO_PORTAGE_EPREFIX@/etc/portage/package.use. These take precedence over
the [D]efault and [P]rofile settings, with package.use overriding settings
from make.conf.
.TP
\fBS : [S]cope of the description.\fR
.br
Local flag descriptions have an 'L' for "local" here.
.TP
\fBi : [i]nstalled.\fR
.br
Indicates with an 'i' if either the listed packages are installed on your
system, or if at least one package that supports this flag is installed.
The latter applies to the global description of the flag.
.TP
\fB(packages): List of packages that support this flag.\fR
.TP
\fBdescription : The description of the flag from use.desc or use.local.desc.\fR
.PP
If the character in any of the D, P or C column is a + then that USE flag was
set in that file(s), if it is a space then the flag was not mentioned in that
file(s) and if it is a - then that flag was unset in that file(s).

Flags marked as [+] or [-] will be saved in your make.conf when you leave the
program by hitting the 'Enter' key.

You can change the order of the (packages) and the description with the F9 key.
