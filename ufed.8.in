ufed \- Gentoo Linux USE flags editor
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B ufed 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
UFED is a simple program designed to help you configure the
systems USE flags (see below) to your liking. To enable or
disable a flag highlight it and hit space.

.B Navigation and control

Use the Up and Down arrow keys, the Page Up and Page Down keys, the Home and
End keys, or start typing the name of a flag to select it.
Use the space bar to toggle the setting.

If ncurses is installed with the "gpm" use flag enabled, you can use your
mouse to navigate and to toggle the settings, too.

After changing flags, press the Return or Enter key to make this permanent,
or press Escape to revert your changes.

Note: Depending on your system, you may need to wait a second before ufed
detects the Escape key or mouse clicks; in some cases, you can use the
ncurses environment variable ESCDELAY to change this. See the ncurses(3X)
manpage for more info.

.B Display layout

ufed will present you with a list of descriptions for each USE flag. If a
description is too long to fit on your screen, you can use the Left and Right
arrow keys to scroll the descriptions.

ufed attempts to show you where a particular use setting came from, and what
its scope and state is.

The display consists of the following information:
 (s) flag  M|DPC|Si| (packages) description

(s)  : Your selection, either '+' to enable, '-' to disable, or empty to keep
the default value.
.br
flag : The name of the flag
.br
M    : Either 'M' for Masked (always disabled), 'F' for Forced (always
enabled) or empty for regular flags.
.br
D    : Default settings from make.defaults.
.br
P    : Package settings from package.use and IUSE for installed packages.
.br
C    : Configration setting from make.conf.
.br
S    : Scope of the description, package specific descriptions have an 'L'
for "local".
.br
i    : 'i' if any affected package is installed.
.br
(packages): List of affected packages
.br
description : The description of the flag from use.desc or use.local.desc.

If the character in any of the D, P or C column is a + then that USE flag was
set in that file, if it is a space then the flag was not mentioned in that
file and if it is a - then that flag was unset in that file.

.B What are USE flags?

The USE settings system is a flexible way to enable or disable various features
at package build-time on a global level and for individual packages. This
allows an administrator to control how packages are built in regards to the
optional features which can be compiled into those packages.

For instance, packages with optional GNOME support can have this support
disabled at compile time by disabling the "gnome" USE flag. Enabling the
"gnome" USE flag would enable GNOME support in these packages.

The effect of USE flags on packages is dependent on whether both the
software itself and the package ebuild supports the USE flag as an optional
feature. If the software does not have support for an optional feature then the
corresponding USE flag will obviously have no effect.

Also many package dependencies are not considered optional by the software and
thus USE flags will have no effect on those mandatory dependencies.

A list of USE keywords used by a particular package can be found by checking
the IUSE line in any ebuild file or by using "equery" from gentoolkit.

See http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=2&chap=2
for more information on USE flags.

Please also note that if UFED describes a flag (Unknown) it generally means
that it is either a spelling error in one of the 3 configuration files or
it is not an officially sanctioned USE flag. Sanctioned USE flags can be found 
in /usr/portage/profiles/use.desc and in /usr/portage/profiles/use.local.desc.
